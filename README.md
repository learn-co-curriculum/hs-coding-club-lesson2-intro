Last club meeting, you touched on why HTML is so powerful and how to write some basic HTML tags. This meeting, you're going to get even better at writing HTML.

##Some Things You Should Know

You're going to be tackling the Album Cover lab today. You'll want to use the lesson as a resource to help you get through the lab. 

If you finish the lab, feel free to take a stab at the Issue Bot lab!

## Share Share Share!

When you finish, don't forget to share your work with your friends with the **\#flatironcodeclub** and **\#pharrellneedsme**
